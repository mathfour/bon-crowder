# Bon Crowder, The Users' Manual

## Introduction
I am painfully creative and curious. This sense of wonder mixed with the lack of fear to experiment propels me through life.

Growing up without Google, I had to figure out the answers to all questions that plagued me. When I was eight I speculated that the staple knew when it was done going through paper and would curl automatically if there was no more paper. Lacking fear, I decided to test a stapleâ€™s knowledge by stapling my finger. I quickly learned the smiley face on the bottom had a purpose other than decoration. I continue to function in this manner in all aspects of my life.

I will do things because I want to learn how to do them, and sometimes for no other reason. I will speculate on anything. I can carry on a conversation about something of which I know nothing, and look good doing it. I can make a viable, logical argument for anything - really anything.

## Communication, Motivation, etc.

**Communication Style**

Face to face is preferred. I "listen" to people's faces and bodies more than their words. Web-based video visits are a far second, right along with telephone conversations. I will communicate via email, but generally find it annoying.

If you need something from me:
Be explicit and make sure all the details are there. If you expect a document from me about my feedback of an event, don't say, "So you'll get back to me on that, right?" Send me an email saying, "Bon, please don't forget to send me a 1 page report on Event X that you attended last night. Include details of how it will affect us as an organization. I would like to have this my next Monday, EOB."

If you need one thing quickly, I am more likely to do something while someone is waiting or if I know that my actions will directly affect someone or something. I have difficulty saying no, but am getting better.

**My primary motivators are:**

- Having a sense of belonging or legacy
- Maintaining peace of mind and calm
- Accomplishing things with a distinct end
- Following my curiosity
- Having fun

**Random things about me:**

- I have written my resume' in rhyme.
- I rebranded myself 4 times.
- I voluntarily went to jail for 28 hours.
